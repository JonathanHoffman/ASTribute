        <li><b>2009</b> - Launches the <em>Progressive Campaign Change Committee</em>. This organization explored progressive activism. As Swartz wrote on his blog "I spend my days experimenting with new ways to get progressive policies enacted and progressive
          politicians elected."</li>
        <li><b>2010</b> - Founds <em>Demand Progress</em>, a political advocacy group that organizes people online to "take action by contacting Congress and other leaders, funding pressure tactics, and spreading the word" about civil liberties, government
          reform, and other issues.</li>

        <li><b>2012</b> - Leads the campaign against SOPA. Swartz was the keynote speaker at the FC2: Freedom to Connect event in Washington, DC., following the defeat of the bill. "We won this fight because everyone made themselves the hero of their own
          story. Everyone took it as their job to save this crucial freedom."</li>
        <li><b>2013</b> - Found dead of suicide in his Brooklyn apartment. Swartz was facing disproportionate charges stemming from his 2008 actions where he downloaded public domain academic articles from the pay-walled <em>PACER</em> database. The articles were later

        <p>Assume nobody else has any idea what they're doing either. A lot of people refuse to try something because they feel they don't know enough about it, or they assume other people must have already tried everything they could have thought of. Well,
          few people really have any idea how to do things right and even fewer are to try new things, so usually if you give your best shot at something you'll do pretty well.</p>
